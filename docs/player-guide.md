# Infinite Maze - Complete Player Guide

Welcome to Infinite Maze! This comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know to master this challenging, fast-paced maze navigation game.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Infinite Maze is a unique twist on classic maze games. Instead of finding an exit, your goal is to survive as long as possible while navigating through an endless, procedurally generated maze. The challenge comes from an ever-accelerating pace that forces you to make quick decisions under pressure.

### What Makes It Special?
- **Truly Infinite**: The maze never ends - it generates new sections as you progress
- **Progressive Challenge**: Every 30 seconds, the pace increases, making survival harder
- **Strategic Scoring**: Smart movement decisions affect your final score
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive movement that feels natural and precise

## üéØ Game Objectives & Rules

### Primary Objective
**Survive as long as possible** while progressing through the infinite maze.

### Initial Game State
When you start a new game, you'll notice a unique setup:

- **Starting Position**: Your player begins on the far left side of the screen
- **Immediate Challenge**: Maze walls are present from the start of the game
- **Strategic Planning**: You'll need to navigate the maze right away
- **Pause Option**: Use the Space key to pause and plan your route

This design challenges players to think strategically from the beginning. Make sure to:
- Use all movement keys (WASD or arrows) to navigate the maze
- Utilize the pause function (Space) to study the maze layout
- Get a feel for the movement speed and responsiveness
- Plan your path carefully through the maze walls

### Scoring System
- **+1 point** for each movement to the right (forward progress)
- **-1 point** for each movement to the left (backtracking)
- **0 points** for vertical movement (up/down)
- **Minimum score**: 0 (score cannot go below zero)

### The Pace Mechanic
The game's signature feature is the advancing "pace line":

1. **Grace Period**: First 30 seconds - no pace pressure, learn the controls
2. **Pace Activation**: After 30 seconds, a boundary begins advancing from the left
3. **Acceleration**: Every 30 seconds, the pace increases speed
4. **Game Over**: When the pace line catches up to your position

### Victory Conditions
There is no traditional "win" condition - the game is about achieving your personal best score and survival time. Challenge yourself to:
- Beat your previous high score
- Survive longer than your last attempt
- Develop strategies for different maze layouts

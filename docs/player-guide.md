# Infinite Maze - Complete Player Guide

Welcome to Infinite Maze! This comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know to master this challenging, fast-paced maze navigation game.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Infinite Maze is a unique twist on classic maze games. Instead of finding an exit, your goal is to survive as long as possible while navigating through an endless, procedurally generated maze. The challenge comes from an ever-accelerating pace that forces you to make quick decisions under pressure.

### What Makes It Special?
- **Truly Infinite**: The maze never ends - it generates new sections as you progress
- **Progressive Challenge**: Every 30 seconds, the pace increases, making survival harder
- **Strategic Scoring**: Smart movement decisions affect your final score
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive movement that feels natural and precise

## üéØ Game Objectives & Rules

### Primary Objective
**Survive as long as possible** while progressing through the infinite maze.

### Initial Game State
When you start a new game, you'll notice a unique setup:

- **Starting Position**: Your player (red dot) begins on the far left side of the screen
- **Safe Zone**: You start in an open area outside the actual maze
- **Maze Entry**: The maze walls begin several hundred pixels to the right of your starting position
- **Free Movement**: Initially, you can move freely in all directions without hitting walls
- **Preparation Time**: This gives you time to get comfortable with the controls before entering the maze proper

This design allows new players to practice movement and understand the controls before facing the challenge of navigating through maze walls. Use this initial safe zone to:
- Test all movement keys (WASD or arrows)
- Practice the pause function (Space)
- Get a feel for the movement speed and responsiveness
- Prepare mentally for entering the maze

### Scoring System
- **+1 point** for each movement to the right (forward progress)
- **-1 point** for each movement to the left (backtracking)
- **0 points** for vertical movement (up/down)
- **Minimum score**: 0 (score cannot go below zero)

### The Pace Mechanic
The game's signature feature is the advancing "pace line":

1. **Grace Period**: First 30 seconds - no pace pressure, learn the controls
2. **Pace Activation**: After 30 seconds, a boundary begins advancing from the left
3. **Acceleration**: Every 30 seconds, the pace increases speed
4. **Game Over**: When the pace line catches up to your position

### Victory Conditions
There is no traditional "win" condition - the game is about achieving your personal best score and survival time. Challenge yourself to:
- Beat your previous high score
- Survive longer than your last attempt
- Develop strategies for different maze layouts

## ‚å®Ô∏è Controls & Movement

### Basic Controls
| Key(s) | Action | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **W** or **‚Üë** | Move Up | No score impact |
| **A** or **‚Üê** | Move Left | Loses 1 point |
| **S** or **‚Üì** | Move Down | No score impact |
| **D** or **‚Üí** | Move Right | Gains 1 point |

## üß© Gameplay Strategies

### Beginner Strategies

#### 1. **Learn the Basics**
- Start by focusing on basic movement without worrying about score
- Get comfortable with the control scheme

- **Gradual Entry**: Move right at your own pace to enter the maze when you're ready
- **Study the Entrance**: Use the initial area to observe maze wall patterns and openings
- **Build Confidence**: Gain familiarity with movement before facing navigation challenges
- **Strategic Timing**: Enter the maze with enough time to establish good positioning before pace begins

### Intermediate Strategies

#### 1. **Efficient Pathfinding**
- Always look for the most direct rightward path
- Use vertical movement to navigate around obstacles

- Only move left when absolutely necessary
- Use vertical paths to find better horizontal routes

### Advanced Strategies

#### 1. **Pattern Recognition**
- Learn common maze generation patterns
- Anticipate wall placements based on previous sections
- Develop muscle memory for common navigation sequences

#### 2. **Speed vs. Safety Balance**
- Fast movement risks mistakes but builds score quickly

- Find your optimal balance between speed and accuracy

#### 3. **Pressure Management**
- Stay calm as pace increases
- Make deliberate decisions even under time pressure
- Practice breathing techniques during intense moments

#### 4. **Advanced Positioning**
- Position yourself for multiple escape routes

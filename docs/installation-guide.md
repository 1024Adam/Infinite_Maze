# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the game
infinite-maze
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### Problem: "Python not found" or "python: command not found"
**Solution:**
1. Verify Python is installed: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
2. On some systems, use `python3` instead of `python`
3. Add Python to your system PATH if necessary

#### Problem: "Poetry not found" after installation
**Solution:**
1. Close and reopen your terminal
2. Add Poetry to your PATH manually:
   - **Windows:** Add `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts` to PATH
   - **Linux/macOS:** Add `~/.local/bin` to PATH
3. Restart your terminal/command prompt

#### Problem: Permission denied errors
**Solution:**
1. **Windows:** Run Command Prompt as Administrator
2. **Linux/macOS:** Use `sudo` if necessary, or check file permissions
3. Ensure you have write access to the installation directory

#### Problem: "No module named 'pygame'" errors
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you're using the correct Python environment
2. Reinstall dependencies: `poetry install` or `pip install pygame`
3. Verify pygame installation: `python -c \"import pygame; print(pygame.version.ver)\"`

#### Problem: Game launches but displays incorrectly
**Solution:**
1. Update your graphics drivers
2. Try running in windowed mode
3. Check display resolution and scaling settings
4. Ensure your system meets minimum requirements

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Windows
- **Issue:** PowerShell execution policy errors
- **Solution:** Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

#### macOS
- **Issue:** "Developer cannot be verified" warnings
- **Solution:** Right-click the app and select "Open" from the context menu

#### Linux
- **Issue:** Missing development headers for pygame compilation
- **Solution:** Install development packages:
  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install python3-dev libsdl2-dev
  
  # Fedora/CentOS
  sudo yum install python3-devel SDL2-devel
  ```

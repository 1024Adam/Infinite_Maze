---

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Code Style and Standards

#### Python Code Style
We use **Black** for automatic code formatting:
```bash
# Format all code
poetry run black infinite_maze/

# Check formatting without changes
poetry run black --check infinite_maze/
```

#### Code Quality
We use **Flake8** for linting:
```bash
# Run linting
poetry run flake8 infinite_maze/

# View specific error details
poetry run flake8 --show-source infinite_maze/
```

#### Type Annotations
We use **MyPy** for static type checking:
```bash
# Run type checking
poetry run mypy infinite_maze/
```

#### Code Standards
- **Function Names**: Use `snake_case`
- **Class Names**: Use `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_CASE`
- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black default)
- **Docstrings**: Use triple quotes with clear descriptions
- **Type Hints**: Add type annotations for function parameters and return values

#### Example Code Style
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

class MazeGenerator:
    """Generates procedural maze layouts."""
    
    def __init__(self, width: int, height: int) -> None:
        """Initialize maze generator with dimensions."""
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        
    def generate_maze(self, complexity: float = 0.5) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
        """Generate a maze with specified complexity.
        
        Args:
            complexity: Maze complexity factor (0.0 to 1.0)
            
        Returns:
            List of wall coordinates as (x, y) tuples
        """
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### 2. Testing Your Changes

#### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run the game to test your changes
poetry run infinite-maze

# Test different scenarios
# - Normal gameplay
# - Pause/resume functionality
# - Game over and restart
# - Edge cases and error conditions
```

#### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run all quality checks
poetry run black infinite_maze/
poetry run flake8 infinite_maze/
poetry run mypy infinite_maze/
```

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Architecture Guidelines

#### 1. Modularity
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use clear interfaces between modules
- Avoid tight coupling between classes

#### 2. Configuration
- Add new settings to `config.py`
- Use type hints for configuration values
- Provide sensible defaults

#### 3. Error Handling
- Handle expected errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately

#### 4. Performance
- Avoid unnecessary computations in the main game loop
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Profile performance-critical code

### Adding New Features

#### 1. Plan Your Feature
- Define the feature's purpose and scope
- Consider how it fits with existing architecture
- Plan the user interface and user experience
- Consider configuration options

#### 2. Implement Step by Step
- Start with core functionality
- Add tests as you go
- Update documentation
- Consider backwards compatibility

#### 3. Example: Adding a New Game Mode

```python
# 1. Add configuration
class GameConfig:
    GAME_MODES = {
        "classic": "Classic infinite maze",
        "timed": "Time-limited challenge",
        "speed": "High-speed variant"
    }

# 2. Extend the Game class
class Game:
    def __init__(self, mode: str = "classic"):
        self.mode = mode
        # Mode-specific initialization
        
    def update_mode_specific_logic(self):
        if self.mode == "timed":
            # Timed mode logic
            pass
        elif self.mode == "speed":
            # Speed mode logic
            pass

# 3. Update the engine
def maze(mode: str = "classic"):
    game = Game(mode=mode)
    # Rest of the game loop
```

### Code Review Process

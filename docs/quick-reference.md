A handy reference card for players and developers.

## 🎮 Player Quick Reference

### ⚡ Getting Started (30 seconds)
1. **Install**: Run `setup.bat` (Windows) or `./setup.sh` (Linux/macOS)
2. **Play**: Game launches automatically, or run `poetry run infinite-maze`
3. **Move**: Use WASD or Arrow keys
4. **Survive**: Stay ahead of the advancing pace line!

### ⌨️ Controls
| Key(s) | Action | Score Impact |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **W** or **↑** | Move Up | No change |
| **A** or **←** | Move Left | **-1 point** |

| **D** or **→** | Move Right | **+1 point** |
| **Space** | Pause/Resume | - |
| **Esc** or **Q** | Quit Game | - |
| **Y/N** | Yes/No (game over) | - |

### 🎯 Game Rules
- **Goal**: Navigate as far right as possible through infinite maze
- **Maze Challenge**: Maze walls present from the beginning
- **Pace**: Starts after 30 seconds, accelerates every 30 seconds
- **Scoring**: +1 for right, -1 for left, 0 for up/down
- **Game Over**: When pace line catches your position

### 🏆 Score Benchmarks

- **Advanced**: 150-300 points
- **Expert**: 300-500 points
- **Master**: 500+ points

### 💡 Quick Tips
- **Use pause** to study maze layout
- **Minimize backtracking** (left movement)
- **Plan vertical routes** to find better horizontal paths
- **Stay calm** as pace increases
- **Look ahead** for escape routes

from infinite_maze import Game, Player, Line, Clock
from infinite_maze.utils.config import config
from infinite_maze.utils.logger import logger

# Basic usage
game = Game()                   # Create game instance
player = Player(80, 223)       # Create player
lines = Line.generateMaze(game, 15, 20)  # Generate maze
```

### 🔍 Configuration
```python
# In utils/config.py
class GameConfig:
    SCREEN_WIDTH = 800          # Window width
    SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600         # Window height
    PLAYER_SPEED = 5            # Movement speed
    FPS = 60                    # Target frame rate

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Installation Issues
```bash
# Python not found
python --version                # Check version (need 3.8+)
which python                   # Check location

# Poetry not found  
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
# Then restart terminal

# Pygame fails
pip install --upgrade pip      # Update pip first
pip install pygame             # Try direct install
```

### Runtime Issues
```bash
# Game won't start
poetry install                 # Reinstall dependencies
poetry run python -v -m infinite_maze  # Verbose output

# Performance problems
# Close other applications
# Update graphics drivers
# Try: poetry run infinite-maze --windowed (if supported)
```

### Development Issues
```bash
# Code quality fails
poetry run black infinite_maze/     # Fix formatting
poetry run flake8 infinite_maze/    # Check specific errors

# Git conflicts
git status                     # See conflicted files
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

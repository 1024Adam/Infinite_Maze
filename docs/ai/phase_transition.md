# Phase Transition Checklist for Infinite Maze AI Training

This document provides specific guidelines and requirements for transitioning between training phases for the Infinite Maze AI model. Each phase builds upon the previous one, using transfer learning to preserve and enhance acquired skills.

## Checkpoint Management

### Saving Checkpoints
- Save model checkpoints at regular intervals (every 50K steps)
- Save special checkpoint when phase success criteria are met
- Include metadata with checkpoint:
  - Training phase
  - Steps completed
  - Performance metrics
  - Hyperparameters

### Loading Checkpoints
- Begin each new phase by loading the best checkpoint from the previous phase
- Verify checkpoint integrity before starting training
- Initialize new components as needed (e.g., new layers for advanced features)

## Performance Testing Between Phases

### Test Suite Components
1. **Standard Tests**:
   - Basic navigation capability
   - Collision avoidance
   - Forward progress efficiency
   - Score accumulation

2. **Phase-Specific Tests**:
   - Phase 2: Pace line avoidance
   - Phase 3: Performance across varied maze types
   - Phase 4: Adaptation to pace increases
   - Phase 5: Recovery from adversarial situations

### Testing Protocol
1. Run 100 episodes per test configuration
2. Calculate mean and standard deviation of key metrics
3. Compare against success criteria thresholds
4. Generate detailed performance report
5. Make go/no-go decision for phase transition

## Addressing Performance Shortfalls

If the model fails to meet success criteria:

### Investigation Steps
1. Analyze failure cases with visualizations
2. Identify common patterns in unsuccessful episodes
3. Review reward signal distribution and gradients
4. Check for signs of catastrophic forgetting

### Remediation Options
1. **Extended Training**: Continue current phase for additional steps
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust learning rate, exploration rate, etc.
3. **Curriculum Adjustment**: Create intermediate difficulty steps
4. **Architecture Review**: Consider model capacity issues
5. **Reward Engineering**: Refine reward function to better guide learning

### Re-evaluation
1. Implement remediation measures
2. Train for additional 20% steps
3. Re-run test suite
4. Document improvements and remaining issues

## Documentation Requirements

For each phase transition, document:

1. **Performance Summary**:
   - Table of metrics vs. criteria
   - Learning curves
   - Action distribution analysis

2. **Model Evolution**:
   - Key capabilities gained
   - Comparison to previous phase performance
   - Known limitations

3. **Environment Changes**:
   - Parameter modifications
   - New features introduced
   - Difficulty progression

4. **Next Phase Expectations**:
   - Anticipated challenges
   - Expected performance gains
   - Critical success factors

This documentation should be stored with model checkpoints for future reference and analysis.

**Note**: This checklist ensures methodical progression through the training curriculum. Following these guidelines will help maintain training integrity and produce a high-quality final model. Never skip a phase or proceed without meeting all success criteria.

## ✍️ Writing Tests

### Test Structure Guidelines

#### Test Class Organization
```python
# tests/unit/test_new_component.py
class TestNewComponent:
    """Test class for NewComponent functionality."""
    
    def test_initialization(self):
        """Test component initialization with default values."""
        # Arrange
        component = NewComponent()
        
        # Act & Assert
        assert component.is_valid()
        assert component.get_default_value() == expected_default
        
    def test_specific_behavior(self):
        """Test specific behavior with descriptive name."""
        # Arrange
        component = NewComponent(param=value)
        
        # Act
        result = component.method_under_test()
        
        # Assert
        assert result == expected_result
```

#### Using Test Fixtures
```python
def test_with_game_fixture(headless_game, test_player):
    """Test using shared fixtures for consistent setup."""
    # Fixtures provide clean, isolated test environment
    game = headless_game  # Pre-configured game instance
    player = test_player  # Pre-positioned test player
    
    # Test implementation
    assert game.isActive()
    assert player.getPosition() == (80, 223)
```

### Test Categories by Change Type

#### New Component Tests
When adding a new component, create unit tests:
```python
# tests/unit/test_new_component.py
class TestNewComponent:
    def test_initialization(self):
        """Test component initializes correctly."""
        pass
        
    def test_core_functionality(self):
        """Test primary component behavior."""
        pass
        
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        """Test boundary conditions and error cases."""
        pass
        
    def test_integration_points(self):
        """Test interfaces with other components."""
        pass
```

#### Feature Integration Tests
When adding features involving multiple components:
```python
# tests/integration/test_new_feature_integration.py
class TestNewFeatureIntegration:
    def test_component_coordination(self):
        """Test components work together correctly."""
        pass
        
    def test_state_synchronization(self):
        """Test state consistency across components."""
        pass
```

#### End-to-End Feature Tests
When adding user-facing features:
```python
# tests/functional/test_new_feature_scenarios.py
class TestNewFeatureScenarios:
    def test_complete_workflow(self):
        """Test complete user workflow with new feature."""
        pass
        
    def test_user_interaction_patterns(self):
        """Test realistic user interaction scenarios."""
        pass
```

#### Performance Impact Tests
When making performance-related changes:
```python
# tests/performance/test_new_performance_aspects.py
@pytest.mark.performance
class TestNewPerformanceAspects:
    def test_performance_baseline(self):
        """Establish performance baseline for new functionality."""
        monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
        monitor.start()
        
        # Performance test implementation
        
        monitor.stop()
        assert monitor.get_duration() < acceptable_threshold
        assert monitor.get_memory_usage() < memory_limit
```

### Test Quality Standards

#### Test Naming Conventions
- **Test files**: `test_<component_name>.py`
- **Test classes**: `Test<ComponentName>`
- **Test methods**: `test_<specific_behavior>`
- **Descriptive names**: Clearly describe what is being tested

#### Test Documentation
```python
def test_player_collision_boundary_detection(self):
    """Test player collision detection at maze boundaries.
    
    Verifies that collision detection correctly identifies when the player
    is at the exact boundary of a maze wall, including edge cases where
    the player position aligns precisely with wall coordinates.
    """
    # Test implementation
```

#### Assertion Guidelines
- **Single concept**: Each test should verify one specific behavior
- **Clear assertions**: Use descriptive assertion messages
- **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Deterministic**: Tests should produce consistent results

#### Example Test Implementation
```python
class TestPlayerMovement:
    def test_move_right_updates_position(self):
        """Test that moving right increases X coordinate by movement speed."""
        # Arrange
        player = Player(100, 200, headless=True)
        initial_x = player.getX()
        
        # Act
        player.moveX(5)  # Move right by 5 pixels
        
        # Assert
        assert player.getX() == initial_x + 5
        assert player.getY() == 200  # Y should remain unchanged
        
    def test_collision_detection_prevents_wall_penetration(self):
        """Test that collision detection prevents player from moving through walls."""
        # Arrange
        player = Player(95, 200, headless=True)
        wall_line = Line(100, 200, 100, 250)  # Vertical wall at x=100
        
        # Act
        player.moveX(10)  # Attempt to move through wall
        collision_detected = wall_line.collision(player)
        
        # Assert
        assert collision_detected == True
        # Player position should be constrained by collision detection
```

## 🔧 Test Infrastructure

### Pygame Mocking Framework

The test suite uses comprehensive pygame mocking to enable headless testing:

#### Key Features
- **No Display Required**: Tests run without actual pygame windows
- **Deterministic Input**: Controlled event simulation
- **Performance Isolation**: Clean performance measurement
- **CI/CD Compatible**: Runs in automated environments

#### Using Mocked Components
```python
def test_with_pygame_mocking(mock_pygame_display):
    """Test using pygame mocking for headless execution."""
    # Pygame display operations are automatically mocked
    game = Game(headless=True)
    
    # All pygame calls are intercepted and handled by mocks
    assert game.initialize() == True
```

### Test Fixtures

#### Core Fixtures (`conftest.py`)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def headless_game():
    """Provide a clean game instance for testing."""
    return Game(headless=True)

@pytest.fixture  
def test_player():
    """Provide a test player at standard position."""
    return Player(80, 223, headless=True)

@pytest.fixture
def test_maze():
    """Provide a test maze with known layout."""
    return generate_test_maze()
```

#### Specialized Fixtures (`fixtures/game_fixtures.py`)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def collision_test_scenarios():
    """Provide predefined collision test scenarios."""
    return [
        {"player_pos": (100, 200), "wall": Line(105, 200, 105, 250), "should_collide": True},
        {"player_pos": (90, 200), "wall": Line(105, 200, 105, 250), "should_collide": False},
        # Additional test scenarios
    ]
```

### Performance Monitoring

#### Performance Test Utilities
```python
class PerformanceMonitor:
    """Monitor performance metrics during testing."""
    
    def start(self):
        """Start performance monitoring."""
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.start_memory = self.get_memory_usage()
        
    def stop(self):
        """Stop monitoring and calculate metrics."""
        self.duration = time.time() - self.start_time
        self.peak_memory = self.get_memory_usage()
        
    def get_duration(self) -> float:
        """Get execution duration in seconds."""
        return self.duration
        
    def get_memory_usage(self) -> int:
        """Get memory usage in MB."""
        # Implementation for memory monitoring
```

#### Using Performance Monitoring
```python
@pytest.mark.performance
def test_collision_detection_performance(self):
    """Test collision detection meets performance targets."""
    monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
    player = Player(100, 200, headless=True)
    walls = generate_performance_test_maze(1000)  # 1000 walls
    
    monitor.start()
    
    # Perform 1 million collision checks
    for _ in range(1000000):
        for wall in walls:
            wall.collision(player)
    
    monitor.stop()
    
    # Verify performance targets
    checks_per_second = 1000000 / monitor.get_duration()
    assert checks_per_second > 1000000  # >1M checks/second target
    assert monitor.get_memory_usage() < 200  # <200MB memory target
```

## 📈 Test Maintenance

### Keeping Tests Updated

#### When Code Changes
1. **Run affected tests**: Identify and run tests related to changed code
2. **Update test data**: Modify test fixtures if interfaces change
3. **Add new tests**: Create tests for new functionality
4. **Update documentation**: Keep test documentation current

#### Regular Maintenance Tasks
```bash
# Weekly: Run full test suite
python run_tests.py all --coverage

# Monthly: Review and update performance baselines
python run_tests.py performance

# Before releases: Comprehensive testing
pytest --run-performance --cov=infinite_maze --cov-report=html
```

### Test Quality Metrics

#### Coverage Monitoring
```bash
# Check current coverage
pytest --cov=infinite_maze --cov-report=term-missing

# Identify untested code
pytest --cov=infinite_maze --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html to see detailed coverage report
```

#### Performance Baseline Updates
Performance baselines should be updated when:
- **Optimization improvements** are made
- **System requirements** change  
- **New features** affect performance characteristics
- **Hardware upgrades** improve baseline capabilities

### Adding Tests for New Features

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Identify test category**: Unit, integration, functional, or performance
2. **Choose appropriate location**: Place in correct `tests/` subdirectory
3. **Use existing patterns**: Follow established test structure
4. **Add appropriate markers**: Use `@pytest.mark.unit`, etc.
5. **Update documentation**: Add test descriptions to this guide

#### Example: Adding Tests for New Game Mode
```python
# tests/unit/test_game_modes.py
class TestGameModes:
    def test_classic_mode_initialization(self):
        """Test classic game mode initializes correctly."""
        game = Game(mode="classic", headless=True)
        assert game.get_mode() == "classic"
        assert game.get_pace_interval() == 30
        
    def test_speed_mode_initialization(self):
        """Test speed game mode has faster pace."""
        game = Game(mode="speed", headless=True)
        assert game.get_mode() == "speed"
        assert game.get_pace_interval() == 15  # Faster pace

# tests/functional/test_game_mode_scenarios.py  
class TestGameModeScenarios:
    def test_classic_mode_complete_gameplay(self):
        """Test complete gameplay session in classic mode."""
        # End-to-end test implementation
        
    def test_mode_switching_preserves_score(self):
        """Test that switching modes preserves player progress."""
        # Mode switching test implementation
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Tests

### Common Test Issues

#### Import Errors
```bash
# Problem: ModuleNotFoundError when running tests
# Solution: Install project in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or add to Python path
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
```

#### Pygame Display Errors
```bash
# Problem: "pygame.error: video system not initialized"
# Solution: Ensure headless mode is enabled
# Tests should use headless=True by default
```

#### Performance Test Failures
```bash
# Problem: Performance tests fail on slower systems
# Solution: Skip performance tests during development
pytest --skip-slow

# Or run performance tests in isolation
pytest -m performance --run-performance
```

#### Coverage Calculation Issues
```bash
# Problem: Coverage reports show incorrect data
# Solution: Install coverage tools explicitly
pip install pytest-cov

# Run with explicit coverage configuration
pytest --cov=infinite_maze --cov-report=html
```

### Debugging Test Failures

#### Verbose Test Output
```bash
# Run tests with detailed output
pytest -v

# Show print statements during tests
pytest -s

# Debug specific test failure
pytest tests/unit/test_player.py::TestPlayerMovement::test_move_right -v -s
```

#### Test Isolation
```bash
# Run single test file
pytest tests/unit/test_player.py

# Run single test method
pytest tests/unit/test_player.py::TestPlayerMovement::test_move_right

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "collision and not performance"
```

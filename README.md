# Infinite Maze Game

A fast-paced, infinitely challenging maze navigation game built with Python and Pygame.

## üéÆ Overview
Infinite Maze is a dynamic maze-style game where players navigate through a randomly generated maze, attempting to progress as far as possible while maintaining pace. The maze is infinite - as long as you can keep up with the advancing pace, the game continues indefinitely.

**What makes this truly challenging:** The game's pace increases every 30 seconds, forcing players to move faster while navigating increasingly complex maze layouts. Can you keep up with the relentless advance?

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Infinite Gameplay**: Procedurally generated mazes that never end
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Pace increases every 30 seconds for escalating challenge
- **Smart Scoring**: Gain points for rightward progress, lose points for backtracking
- **Responsive Controls**: Smooth WASD or arrow key movement
- **Pause System**: Take a breather when needed
- **Modern Architecture**: Clean, extensible Python codebase with Poetry dependency management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### One-Command Setup (Recommended)
Get up and running in seconds:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./setup.sh

# Windows
setup.bat
```

These scripts will automatically:
- Check if Poetry is installed (and guide you to install it if needed)
- Install all project dependencies
- Verify everything works correctly
- Launch the game

### Manual Installation
If you prefer more control over the installation process:

```bash
# 1. Install Poetry (one-time setup per machine)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# 2. Install dependencies and run the game
poetry install
poetry run infinite-maze
```

### Alternative Running Methods
Once installed, you can run the game multiple ways:

```bash
# Modern entry point (recommended)
poetry run infinite-maze

# Python module execution
python -m infinite_maze

# Direct execution (legacy, still supported)
python run_game.py
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install with development dependencies
poetry install

# Code formatting
poetry run black infinite_maze/

# Code linting
poetry run flake8 infinite_maze/

# Type checking
poetry run mypy infinite_maze/
```

### First-Time Developer Setup
If you're new to the project:

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Run the setup script**: `./setup.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `setup.bat` (Windows)
3. **Start developing!**

The setup script will:
- Check if Poetry is installed (and guide you to install it if needed)
- Install all project dependencies
- Verify everything works correctly

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Core Elements
|  Element   |  Description  |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| **Player** | Your character (red dot) that moves through the maze |
| **Pace Line** | The advancing boundary that pursues you - stay ahead or the game ends |
| **Maze Walls** | Dynamically generated barriers that block your movement |
| **Scoring** | Points awarded for rightward progress, deducted for leftward movement |

### Game Rules
- **Objective**: Navigate as far right through the infinite maze as possible
- **Scoring System**: 
  - +1 point for each rightward movement
  - -1 point for each leftward movement (minimum score: 0)
- **Pace Mechanic**: 
  - Starts after 30 seconds
  - Accelerates every 30 seconds thereafter
  - Forces continuous forward progress
- **Game Over**: When the pace line catches up to your position

### Strategy Tips
- **Plan Ahead**: Look for openings in the maze before the pace forces movement
- **Minimize Backtracking**: Leftward movement costs points and wastes time
- **Use Vertical Space**: Moving up/down doesn't affect score but can find better paths
- **Stay Calm**: The pace increases, but panicking leads to poor decisions

## ‚å®Ô∏è Controls
|  Key(s)        |  Action                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| **W, A, S, D** | Move up, left, down, right |
| **Arrow Keys** | Alternative movement controls |
| **Space**      | Pause/unpause game |
| **Esc, Q**     | Quit game |
| **Y, N**       | Yes/No responses when prompted |

## üìã System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.8-3.12)
- **Dependencies**: Pygame 2.5+ (automatically managed by Poetry)
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Memory**: ~50MB RAM
- **Storage**: ~10MB disk space

### For Different Audiences
- **New Players**: Start with [Installation Guide](docs/installation-guide.md), then [Player Guide](docs/player-guide.md)
- **Developers**: Check [Development Guide](docs/development.md) and [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md)
- **Contributors**: Read [Contributing Guide](docs/contributing.md) and [API Reference](docs/api-reference.md)

## Development

### Code Quality Tools
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Flake8**: Code linting and style checking
- **MyPy**: Static type checking
- **Pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality (optional)

### Task Runners (Optional)
For convenience, you can use modern task runners instead of remembering Poetry commands:

#### Just (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Just: cargo install just
just setup     # Setup project
just run       # Run the game
just format    # Format code
just check     # Run all quality checks
```

#### Make (Traditional)
If you prefer the traditional approach, basic commands:
```bash
# You can create your own Makefile with Poetry commands
poetry install  # instead of 'make install'
poetry run infinite-maze  # instead of 'make run'
```

### Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes with proper type hints and documentation
4. Run the code quality tools
5. Submit a pull request

## Migration from Legacy Version
If you're upgrading from an older version using Makefile/setup.py:

```bash
# Run the migration script
python migrate_to_modern.py
```

This will:
- Back up your old configuration files
- Set up Poetry and modern dependencies
- Verify the new installation works correctly

## Dependencies
- **Pygame**: Game development library for graphics, sound, and input handling

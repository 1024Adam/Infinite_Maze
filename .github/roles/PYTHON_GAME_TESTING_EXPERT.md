## Testing Architecture Patterns

### 1. Dependency Injection for Testability
```python
# Example testable game component
class GameEngine:
    def __init__(self, renderer, input_handler, audio_system):
        self.renderer = renderer
        self.input_handler = input_handler
        self.audio_system = audio_system
    
    def update(self, dt):
        # Testable game logic
        pass

# Test with mocked dependencies
def test_game_engine_update():
    mock_renderer = Mock()
    mock_input = Mock()
    mock_audio = Mock()
    
    engine = GameEngine(mock_renderer, mock_input, mock_audio)
    engine.update(16.67)  # One frame at 60 FPS
    
    # Assert expected behavior
```

### 2. Test Isolation and Cleanup
```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def pygame_setup_teardown():
    """Ensure clean Pygame state for each test"""
    pygame.init()
    yield
    pygame.quit()

@pytest.fixture
def mock_display():
    """Provide mock display surface for testing"""
    return pygame.Surface((800, 600))
```

### 3. Property-Based Testing
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=800),
       st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=600))
def test_player_position_bounds(x, y):
    player = Player(x, y)
    assert 0 <= player.x <= 800
    assert 0 <= player.y <= 600

    menu = MainMenu()
    menu.render(display_surface)
    
    # Compare with baseline screenshot
    actual = pygame_to_pil(display_surface)
    expected = load_baseline_image("main_menu.png")
    
    assert images_are_similar(actual, expected, threshold=0.95)
```

### 2. Input Simulation Testing
```python
def test_player_movement_sequence():
    """Test complex player movement patterns"""
    game = Game()
    
    # Simulate input sequence
    inputs = [
        (pygame.KEYDOWN, pygame.K_RIGHT, 100),  # Move right for 100ms
        (pygame.KEYDOWN, pygame.K_UP, 50),      # Jump for 50ms
        (pygame.KEYUP, pygame.K_RIGHT, 0),      # Stop moving right
    ]
    
    for event_type, key, duration in inputs:
        game.handle_input(create_key_event(event_type, key))
        game.update(duration)
    
    # Assert expected player state
    assert game.player.x > initial_x
    assert game.player.is_jumping
```

### 3. Deterministic Testing with Seeded Randomness
```python
@pytest.fixture
def seeded_random():
    """Provide deterministic randomness for testing"""
    random.seed(42)
    numpy.random.seed(42)
    yield
    # Reset to random state
    random.seed()
```
